# Autoregressive Neural Networks

### Paper presented in the Bulletin of Scientific Initiation of Mathematics (BICMAT).

Summary: 
> In this article, we will make a brief study on Autoregressive Neural
Networks for time series analysis. We will seek to understand how this particular
neural network architecture works and how it works for predictions. In the end,
we will make a comparison of the performance of estimated predictions between
the neural network model and the ARIMA model, which is well known for this
purpose, with Google stock data from 2015. It is noteworthy, that my knowledge
of Neural Networks is still very little, so the main focus of the work will reside in
its statistical use

1. Artificial Neural Networks. What are?
2. Autoregressive Neural Networks.
3. ARIMA model.
4. Methodology.
5. A comparision between the two models.
